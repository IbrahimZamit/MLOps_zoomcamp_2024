# MLOps Explained: Key Concepts and Benefits

## Introduction to MLOps
- MLOps is the application of DevOps principles and practices to the machine learning workflow. 
- The goal of MLOps is to enable faster experimentation and model development, faster deployment of updated models to production, and quality assurance.
- MLOps helps streamline the ML process and define a seamless handoff between data scientists and ML engineers/developers.

## Why is MLOps Needed?
- MLOps addresses the needs that arise in a typical machine learning workflow, such as:
  1. Tracking versions of source data and its attributes (quality, lineage, etc.) for reproducibility.
  2. Tracking metrics of experiment runs to inform model development. 
  3. Source control of code, environments, and dependencies for reproducibility.
  4. Enabling the use of ML pipelines to checkpoint and reuse sub-steps in the workflow.
  5. Validating and deploying models in a automated and predictable way.
  6. Monitoring models for performance, fairness, and concept/data drift to trigger retraining.

## What is MLOps?
- MLOps is a process that enables data scientists and IT/engineering teams to collaborate and increase the pace of model development, alongside continuous integration and deployment with proper monitoring, validation, and governance of machine learning models.
- The depth of MLOps engagement depends on the specific needs of the scenario, ranging from experiment tracking and automated deployment to tracking code, data, and drift for automated retraining.

## Benefits of MLOps
- Enables scalability and management of ML models
- Provides reusability and reproducibility of ML pipelines
- Improves productivity and meets audit/regulatory requirements
- Enables effortless CI/CD for up-to-date ML models with lineage
- Simplifies maintenance of model health and governance
- Advocates for responsible AI practices like interpretability and fairness
